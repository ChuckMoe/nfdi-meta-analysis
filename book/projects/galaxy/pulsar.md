# Pulsar

[Pulsar](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar) is a Python server application that allows a [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) server to run jobs on **remote systems** (including Windows) *without requiring a shared mounted file systems*. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.

Full documentation for the project can be found on [Read The Docs](https://pulsar.readthedocs.io/).
